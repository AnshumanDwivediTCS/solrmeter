#summary Run SolrMeter in headless mode
=Run SolrMeter in headless mode=
Until version 0.3.0, you can't run SolrMeter without UI, but since the issue #94 was contributed it is possible to run in "headless mode". There has been no release after this contribution was committed, so if you need this feature, you'll need to [http://code.google.com/p/solrmeter/wiki/Usage#Compile_from_trunk build from trunk]. To understand how this feature works see:

(As mentioned in one of the blog's comments, you don't need to apply the patch, as it is already included in the trunk)
